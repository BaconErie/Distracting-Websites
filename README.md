Lists of Distracting Websites

## How lists are organized

All lists and their respective folders are located in the [lists folder](https://github.com/BaconErie/Distracting-Websites/tree/main/lists).

Under the lists folder contains more folders. These folders group lists based on their type. For example, the games folder contains lists with gaming sites. 

Under each category folder, there may be up to four files. Some category folders will have less files. Information for each file is listed below:

- [CATEGORY NAME]-all.txt: Contains every blocked entry, including domain names, URLs, and regexs
- [CATEGORY NAME]-domains.txt: Contains ONLY domains (e.g. example.com, but not https://example.com/foo)
- [CATEGORY NAME]-urls: Contains ONLY URLs, with path and https/http
- [CATEGORY NAME]-regex: Contains
