Lists of Distracting Websites

## This repo is too complicated! I already use a blocker and just want to create a list for that blocker!

If you use Cold Turkey, stayFocusd, LeechBlock NG, or Distract Me Not, you can use this tool I created to easily make lists for your blocker. The link is [here](https://baconerie.github.io/Distracting-Websites-List-Creator/).

If you use a blocker that is not supported, PLEASE make an issue that suggests to support your blocker.

## Information about the "lists" folder
Inside the lists folder contains more folders which contain the actual lists. Each entry in the lists is seperated with a line break. **More information can be found in the README.md file of the lists folder.**
